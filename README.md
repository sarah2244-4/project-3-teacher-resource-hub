## User Experience (UX)

### Goals

The goal of the site is to provide an interactive revision quiz that allows users to select answers and find out how well they have done.

Users want to be able to intuitively interact and play the quiz, receive immediate feedback and see how well they have done. 

### Users

Users will primarily be Key Stage 3 students (11-14 year olds) looking for a revision tool to revise by answering practise questions before an exam. 

### New User Stories

As a first time user of the site I want to be able to:
- View information so I know what the quiz is about
- View instructions so I know how to play
- Easily and intuitively navigate the game without using the browser buttons
- Know when I get an answer correct or incorrect
- Find out the correct answer if I get an answer incorrect to learn
- Find out my overall score to see how well I did 
- See what question I am on to track my progress

### Existing User Stories

As an existing user I want to be able to:
- See if I have improved by comparing my score to previous tries
- Answer different questions each time I play so I have a wide range of revision
- Know when I get an answer correct or incorrect
- Find out the correct answer if I get an answer incorrect to learn
- Spend different amounts of time answering the quiz depending how long I have to revise

### Colour Scheme

The site's colour scheme is based on the palette:

![Colour scheme](resourcehub/static/assets/images/colour-scheme.JPG)

The colour palette was selected using the palette generator on [Coolors](coolors.co).
- Blue is associated with trust and intelligence, which is important so users feel they can trust the website and the resources are of high quality. 
- Yellow was chosen as it is associated with happiness, confidence and creativity. All of these are feelings users need to have when uploading their own work. 
- Red was chosen as a contrasting colour to the blue. 
- The off-white was added as a background to the body as the white was too harsh on the eyes and it's easier for people to read from, including those with Dyslexia for example.

I used a [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure elements had a high enough contrast ratio.

### Typography

The font Franklin Gothic Medium was chosen for headers and buttons as it is a bold sans-serif font that helps everything stand out. For the smaller text, a different font was chosen as it complements the header font. 

### Effects 

- When the mouse hovers over a button, the colour changes to a contrasting colour (blue to red) to make it clear to the user it can be clicked on. 
- The cursor changes to a pointer when it hovers over a button or a link to show you can click it.
- The continue button changes to a try again button so users watch it move and grow. This is to make it catch the eye and add emphasis on having another go. 

### Design choices

- The site is as consistent as possible across all screen sizes. 
- The buttons were animated to make it clear that they could be selectable. 
- I included very basic instructions on how to play as there are many quizzes that work in the same way, which everyone will be familiar with. 
- The buttons for the number of questions are above the start button so users know to click this before starting the game. 
- I tried adding in a background image to the start screen but it obscured to elements in front so I added it to the body instead so everything was still clear. I used a fun science doodle image as most users will be children.
  - The white start and game container in front of the background image allows all elements in front to be seen clearly. 
- The landing page for a desktop had too much white space around the start button. I added images, which are also science doodles, to add some colour to the page and make it more engaging for young users. These images don't fit on a mobile so are hidden as there is no extra white space to fill. 
- Originally the choices were shown in a 2x2 grid, as this is common in quizzes, but some of the answers are too long so I changed them to longer choice boxes that are stacked above each other as it is more readable. 





Future features - images of documents if more time to implement for all the types of documents that would be uploaded, love button, comments, filter by topic within each subject, upload more than 1 file for each resource.

unfixed bugs - dropdown font wouldn't change
